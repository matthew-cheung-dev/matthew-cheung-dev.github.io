- I joined Virtalis as a Junior Software Product Developer in August 2019.
- Moved onto being a Professional Software Product Developer in April 2021.

During my time at Virtalis I have been maintaining the main product Visionary Render and later on 
joined another team to assist in developing Virtalis Reach a web client used to run Visionary Render scenes.
